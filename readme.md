# Introduction to Silk

## Overview

Silk is a compiled language that is based on the concept of composite programming. It is designed to be expressive, concise, and easy to learn. The name "Silk" was chosen for this language because it represents the smooth and flowing nature of the language. Just like how silk is a luxurious and elegant fabric, the Silk language is designed to be expressive and easy to use.

One of the key features of Silk is its ability blocks, which allow you to define reusable pieces of code called abilities. These abilities can then be combined to create new types (called boxes) that have the specified behavior. This allows you to easily create complex, modular code that is easy to understand and maintain.

In addition to ability blocks, Silk also has a powerful type inference system and a rich set of functions, including support for anonymous functions, first-class functions, and generics. These features make it easy to write concise and expressive code that is easy to understand and maintain.

Overall, the Silk language is designed to be a pleasure to use, with a focus on simplicity and elegance. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or a beginner, we believe that you'll find Silk to be a delightful and intuitive language to work with.

## Caution

> ğŸ“• The language is in the very early stages of development, it's a personal project, but I'd like your help. If you have some ideas, please bring them to me. I will try to finish! Or join me as we develop Silk.

## Key Features

- Ability blocks: Silk has a unique feature called ability blocks, which allow you to define reusable pieces of code called abilities. You can then use these abilities to define new types (called boxes) that have the specified behavior.
- Type inference: Silk has a powerful type inference system that allows you to write code without explicitly specifying types for variables and function arguments. The compiler will automatically deduce the correct types for you.
- Functions: Silk has a rich set of functions, including support for anonymous functions, first-class functions, and generics.
- Code blocks: Silk allows you to define code blocks that have their own scope, which can be useful for creating temporary variables or grouping related code together.

## Getting Started
## -> [Silk syntax and usage until now](detail_imaginary.md) <-

To start using Silk, you will need to install the Silk compiler on your machine. You can then create a new Silk source file (with a .silk extension) and start writing code.
